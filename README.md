# Project Euler Solutions
> I made this repository solely because I wanted to have some sort of a 'progress' thingy. However, if someone finds this helpful (even though my approach to these problems should mostly be naive), then they can utilise my solutions as much as they want.

### Note:
If you're just trying to "cheat" your way into these problems, then as much as I recommend not doing that as I think it ruins all the fun, there are way better (with faster runtime) solutions out on the internet (on Stack Overflow, for instance) so if you're gonna cheat anyway then at least do it better.

#### Side Note:
I'm adding some lines to check the runtime just for fun or maybe because I'm too lazy to make my text editor do it automatically or choose one that does.
