<h4> This is sort of my <i>"backup repository"</i> for dumping the codes for the Project-Euler problems.</h4>
<p> I'm adding some lines to check the runtime just for fun or maybe because I'm too lazy to make my text editor do it automatically or choose one that does.</p> 
<h5>I made this repository solely because I wanted to have some sort of a 'progress' thingy. However, if someone finds this helpful (even though my approach to these problems should mostly be naive), then they can utilise my solutions as much as they want.</h5>
<h4> Also, if you're trying to just <i>"cheat"</i> your way into these problems, then as much as I recommend not doing that (as I think it ruins all the fun), there are way better (with faster runtime) solutions out on the internet (on <i>Stack Overflow</i>, for instance)
