<h2> This is sort of my <i>"backup repository"</i> for dumping my codes for the Project-Euler problems.</h2>
</br> 
<h3>I made this repository solely because I wanted to have some sort of a <i>'progress'</i> thingy. However, if someone finds this helpful (even though my approach to these problems should mostly be naive), then they can utilise my solutions as much as they want.</h3>
</br>
<h4> Also, if you're trying to just <i>"cheat"</i> your way into these problems, then as much as I recommend not doing that (as I think it ruins all the fun), there are way better (with faster runtime) solutions out on the internet (on <i>Stack Overflow</i>, for instance)</h4>
</br>
<p>Lastly, I'm adding some lines to check the runtime just for fun or maybe because I'm too lazy to make my text editor do it automatically or choose one that does.</p>
