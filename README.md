<h3> This is just a repository where I put my code for the Project Euler problems. </h3>
<p> I'm adding some lines to check the runtime just for fun or maybe because I'm too lazy to make my text editor do it automatically or choose one that does.</p> 
<h4> I didn't make this to help those trying to cheat. So please don't... like... cheat.</h4>
